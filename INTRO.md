We are an Estonian startup that operates under a license granted by the Estonian government and that seeks to solve the current problems of traditional contracts with the latest technologies.
The target of **Owlier** is to send and sign contracts easily, as well as any other document from a computer or mobile device, making use of the Blockchain technology when it is necessary, without needing to know anything about blockchain, **even your grandma can use it!**

Check out our introductory video:

# Why Owlier for a Super Representative?
We intend to be one of the most important blockchain-based companies, for that reason and because only such 27 Super Representatives can vote for the decisions on the Tron blockchain, we apply to become a Tron representative and to be able to participate in the future of this blockchain. On the other hand, how many actual SR ask you about the different proposals? We want to give that power to the people that vote for us.
